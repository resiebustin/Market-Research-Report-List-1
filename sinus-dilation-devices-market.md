<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sinus Dilation Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Sinus Dilation</li><li>No-Balloon Sinus Dilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sinus dilation devices market comprises two main types: balloon sinus dilation and no-balloon sinus dilation. Balloon sinus dilation involves the use of a balloon catheter that is inserted into the sinus cavity and inflated to widen the passage for improved drainage and airflow. In contrast, no-balloon sinus dilation techniques utilize other methods, such as drills or suction devices, to achieve sinus opening without balloons. Both approaches aim to relieve symptoms of chronic sinusitis and enhance patient outcomes.</p></p>
