<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Transplant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ex Vivo</li><li>In Vivo</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gene transplant market comprises two primary types: ex vivo and in vivo. Ex vivo gene therapy involves modifying a patient’s cells outside the body, often using a viral vector, and then reintroducing them to treat diseases. In contrast, in vivo therapy delivers therapeutic genes directly into the patient’s body, targeting specific cells or tissues. Both approaches aim to correct genetic defects or enhance cell function, playing critical roles in treating genetic disorders, cancer, and other diseases.</p></p>
