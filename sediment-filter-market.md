<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sediment Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Filters</li><li>Depth Filters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sediment filter market is divided into two primary types: surface filters and depth filters. Surface filters primarily remove particles from the fluid's surface, utilizing a porous medium that captures contaminants as the liquid passes through. In contrast, depth filters trap particles throughout the filter's thickness, providing a larger filtration area and improved dirt-holding capacity. Both types cater to various applications, including water treatment, industrial processes, and HVAC systems, enhancing fluid quality and extending equipment lifespan.</p></p>
